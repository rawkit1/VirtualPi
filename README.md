# VirtualPi
Raspberry Pi-Powered Virtual Reality.

This is a project in the very early stages designed to bring virtual reality to the Raspberry Pi. We're taking some parts from a stripped-down VR Box and using it as a base for the first prototype. You can check out what we've done and need to do in the issues page.
